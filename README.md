# LinearSearch

This code performs a linear search on an array to find a target element. 
 The code starts by creating an integer array with some values. 
 Then, the user is prompted to enter the target element. 
 Next, the linear search function is called, passing the array and target element as parameters. 
 The linear search function iterates over each element in the array using a for loop. 
 If the current element matches the target element, the function returns the index of that element. 
 If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target element was not found. 
 Finally, the result of the linear search is displayed to the user. If the result is -1, a message is printed indicating that the target element was not found. Otherwise, a message is printed indicating the index at which the target element was found.
